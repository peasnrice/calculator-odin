My Odin Project Calculator Assignment [(See Project: Calculator)](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)

Styling mimics the iOS calculator app.
The calculator has keyboard support, even including backspace to remove the last digit.

Things to improve / add: 
* After dividing by 0 it's currently possible to attempt another calculation, which returns NaN. No bueno.
* ðŸ˜Š button does nothing at the moment, would like to have this have a quirky function, display a modal or have some other effect. Will revisit once I've finished the course.
* Embed the calculator within my website, when I get there.
